PYCEV: SEL Compessed EVent Record Reader in Python
==================================================

`pycev`, is intended to provide a means to interpret and interact with SEL CEV files
for scientific analysis using common Python tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and others.
This package provides a parser and manager system to load and interact with SEL Compressed Event
files. Potential avenues to explore for future development include a COMTRADE conversion tool to
allow CEV to COMTRADE conversions, or to write CEV files from raw data.

The CEV file format was developed by
`Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories <https://selinc.com/>`_ for use primarily with
protective electric relays, and other intelligent electronic devices, and is actively maintained.
CEV files, or Compressed EVent records, contain information relating to faults encountered on
electrical power systems. They are especially useful in post-event-analysis and for ongoing
system development.
