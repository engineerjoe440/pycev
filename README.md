# PyCEV
*Python interpreter for SEL (Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories) CEV (Compressed EVent record) files.*

***NOTE:*** This project is in VERY early stages of development and is nowhere near completion.

## Description:
This project, `pycev`, is intended to provide a means to interpret and interact with SEL CEV files for scientific
analysis using common Python tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and others. This package provides
a parser and manager system to load and interact with SEL Compressed Event files. Potential avenues to
explore for future development include a COMTRADE conversion tool to allow CEV to COMTRADE conversions,
or to write CEV files from raw data.
